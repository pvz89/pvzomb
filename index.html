            <h3>Complete Plants Guide</h3>
            <p>
                Success in Plants vs. Zombies relies heavily on understanding each plant's unique abilities and optimal usage scenarios. Sunflowers remain essential for resource generation, while Peashooters form the backbone of basic defense.
            </p>
            <p>
                Advanced plants like the Melon-pult offer area damage capabilities, crucial for handling waves of zombies. The Threepeater provides multi-lane coverage, making it invaluable for managing simultaneous zombie approaches.
            </p>

            <h3>Zombie Types and Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                Understanding zombie varieties is crucial for developing effective defense strategies. Basic zombies serve as cannon fodder but can overwhelm unprepared players in large numbers. Cone-head and Bucket-head zombies require stronger firepower to eliminate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Special variants like the Pole Vaulting Zombie and Newspaper Zombie demand specific counter-strategies. The game introduces increasingly challenging zombie types as players progress, including the formidable Gargantuar and the sneaky Digger Zombie.
